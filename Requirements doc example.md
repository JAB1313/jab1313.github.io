FM - THS Redesign
=================================

## Project Brief
Redesigning The Home Story website and adding a special post type to the homepage.  The redesign will be desktop, mobile & tablet, broken out into
two phases.

### Stakeholders
AM: Damien Cortese   
PM: Jason Betancourt
Lead Dev: Ryan Carlson

### Discovery Notes
The homepage RSS feed "News Wire" will work similarly to how we did it for GE Ventures, where the RSS feeds will pull in stories realtime and be automated. This will be limited to the latest 3 stories. The RSS feeds will use the predefined logos from each feed as the image (ex. CNN & CNBC).
